Module 6 Challenge
I obviously couldn't finish the challenge. I'm turning in what I was able to finish as it's getting harder and harder to find the time to go back and watch the class recordings. I am too far behind as it is.
I found code from this video useful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs63JUeBEZQ&list=PLBNHcTwrlK2h-3_kPuZo597i3mMUOA0oe&index=8
I also used this repository to help figure out the code: https://github.com/ginaleonardi/python_api_challenge/blob/main/WeatherPy.ipynb
I used the Bing chatbot extensively in helping me write code as well.
